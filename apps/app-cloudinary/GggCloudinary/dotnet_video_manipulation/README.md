After uploading videos to Cloudinary, they can be manipulated in many ways.

The syntax for transforming and delivering videos is generally the same 
as that for images, and you can apply the majority of available image 
transformations to video as well. For example, you can resize, crop, 
rotate, set video quality and format or use auto quality and/or auto_format, 
add text or image overlays to your videos, and more.
