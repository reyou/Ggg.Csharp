The following conclusions can be made from it:

The query is a single ID lookup, since the Gremlin statement follows the pattern g.V('id').
Judging from the time metric, the latency of this query seems to be high since it's more than 10ms for a single point-read operation.
If we look into the storeOps object, we can see that the fanoutFactor is 5, which means that 5 partitions were accessed by this operation.
As a conclusion of this analysis, we can determine that the first query is accessing more partitions than necessary. This can be addressed by specifying the partitioning key in the query as a predicate. This will lead to less latency and less cost per query. Learn more about graph partitioning. A more optimal query would be g.V('tt0093640').has('partitionKey', 't1001').
