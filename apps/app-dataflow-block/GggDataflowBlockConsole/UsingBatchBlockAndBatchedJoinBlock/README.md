Walkthrough: Using BatchBlock and BatchedJoinBlock to Improve Efficiency
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/parallel-programming/walkthrough-using-batchblock-and-batchedjoinblock-to-improve-efficiency

This batching mechanism is useful when you collect data from one or more sources 
and then process multiple data elements as a batch. 
For example, consider an application that uses dataflow to insert records into a 
database. This operation can be more efficient if multiple items are inserted at the 
same time instead of one at a time sequentially. This document describes how to 
use the BatchBlock<T> class to improve the efficiency of such database insert 
operations. It also describes how to use the BatchedJoinBlock<T1,T2> class to capture 
both the results and any exceptions that occur when the program reads 
from a database.
